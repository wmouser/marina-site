<h2>A Brief History of Beaver Lake</h2>

<p>While there  are 7 marinas, 12 parks and myriad recreational opportunities available on the lake  today, the original purpose of the lake was much more utilitarian. Flooding was  a serious concern in the early 20th Century not only in Northwest  Arkansas, but all across the United States. The lake's namesake comes from the town of Beaver in Carroll County. The lake was originally planned to go in near this area but geographical concerns eventually moved it to a few miles outside of Eureka Springs.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The project began in 1960 and was complated by the summer of 1966. It was not long after completion that the lake's potential for recreation was explored. In the summer of 1967, the first bass tournament took place n the lake. In addtion to flood control, the lake provides drinking water to almot a half million Arkansas residents.</p>
