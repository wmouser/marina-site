<h2>Our History</h2>
<p><strong>A Family Business</strong><br>
In 1985,  Bill and Pat Urban purchased War Eagle Marina. Originally from Chicago, Bill  was on vacation visiting family here in Arkansas when he noticed a &ldquo;Marina for  Sale&rdquo; ad on a gas station bulletin board. On a whim, Bill called the number on  the ad and made a truly low-ball offer. Surprisingly, the offer was accepted  and before they knew it, the Urbans moved to Arkansas to begin a new chapter in  their lives.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The marina they purchased had 87 stalls. They were all wooden and either 16 or 18 feet. At the height of expansion, the marina had over 330 stalls. However, with the cost of upkeep and with the help of damaging winds and currents, the marina presently has 200 stalls.</p>
<p><br>
  In 2000, the  Urban&rsquo;s daughter Debbie and her husband Mike moved to Arkansas to help with the  business, with the intention of eventually taking over the marina. They did finally take over in 2004 and have been running the marina ever since</p>
