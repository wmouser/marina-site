<p><strong>Directions:</strong></p>
<p>Take Highway 412 West and turn down  County Road 389 towards Nob Hill. Stay left as you pass Patrick&rsquo;s Hamburgers  and continue heading North. There will be two more forks in the road and you  will need to stay left each time. Finally, you will see a sign for the War  Eagle Campgrounds. Take the left towards the campgrounds and you will soon see  the gatehouse.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If there is someone at the gatehouse,  simply tell them you are headed down to the marina. From the gatehouse, the  shortest way to the marina is to head up the hill to the left past the  pavilion. Continue down the other side of the hill and you will take a left at  the brick outhouse building. Contiue past the gravel parking lot and you will  eventually see the ramp down to the main walkway. Through the gate, head left  to get to the store.</p>
